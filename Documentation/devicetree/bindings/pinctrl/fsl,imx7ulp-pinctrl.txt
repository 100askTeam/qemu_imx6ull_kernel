* Freescale i.MX7ULP IOMUX Controller

Please refer to fsl,imx-pinctrl.txt in this directory for common binding part
and usage.

Required properties:
- compatible: "fsl,imx7ulp-iomuxc-0" or "fsl,imx7ulp-iomuxc-1"
- fsl,pins: two integers array, represents a group of pins mux and config
  setting. The format is fsl,pins = <PIN_FUNC_ID CONFIG>, PIN_FUNC_ID is a
  pin working on a specific function, CONFIG is the pad setting value like
  pull-up for this pin. Please refer to imx7ulp datasheet for the valid pad
  config settings.

NOTE: i.MX7ULP PIN_FUNC_ID consists of 4 integers as it shares one mux and
config register as follows:
<mux_conf_reg input_reg mux_mode input_val>

CONFIG bits definition:
PAD_CTL_OBE			(1 << 17)
PAD_CTL_IBE			(1 << 16)
PAD_CTL_LK			(1 << 15)
PAD_CTL_DSE_HIGH		(1 << 6)
PAD_CTL_DSE_STD			(0 << 6)
PAD_CTL_ODE_OPEN_DRAIN		(1 << 5)
PAD_CTL_ODE_PUSH_PULL		(0 << 5)
PAD_CTL_SRE_SLOW		(1 << 2)

PAD_CTL_PE_PULL			(1 << 1)
PAD_CTL_PS_UP			(1 << 0)
PAD_CTL_PS_DOWN			(0 << 0)

Refer to imx7ulp-pinfunc.h in device tree source folder for all available
imx7ulp PIN_FUNC_ID.
